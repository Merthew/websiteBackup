			<b>Hello and welcome.</b><br>My name is Timothy Patterson or otherwise known as Merthew. This is the launch page for all of my javascript endeavors. 
			I do plan to add more than that in the future but due to current lack of content, that will be for the future.
			<br>Please take a look around and contact me with any questions.
