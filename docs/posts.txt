Hello and welcome to the new resign of my personal website. My name is Merthew and in my free time I like to dabble in some extracurricular computer science projects. As a first update post, this is really more of a test for my design efforts, but none the less, it will be the first. With that bit out of the way then, welcome, to Aleph_Null.<br>
